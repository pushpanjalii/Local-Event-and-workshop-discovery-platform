Local Event and Workshop Discovery Platform

## 1. Project Overview
The **Local Event and Workshop Discovery Platform** is a full-stack MERN application that helps users discover, save, and review local events and workshops. This platform aims to simplify finding niche, local events such as pottery classes, coding workshops, or book clubs, which are often hard to find on larger commercial platforms.  

The platform includes features like location-based filtering, user interactions, personalized dashboards, and robust search functionality, providing a complete solution for event discovery and community engagement.


## 2. Problem Statement
Finding local events or workshops can be difficult. Major platforms focus on large-scale commercial events, leaving small, unique, local events scattered and hard to discover. Users often have to search across multiple sites without a centralized resource.  


### Solution
A centralized platform where:  
- Organizers can post events.  
- Users can discover, filter, and save events.  
- Community interaction is possible via reviews and ratings.  
- Location-based filtering allows users to find nearby events.  


## 3. Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login for regular users and event organizers.  
- **Event Creation (CRUD)**: Organizers can create, update, and delete events with details like date, time, location, and description.  
- **Event Discovery**: Displays upcoming events with filters by category (Arts, Tech, Health) and date.  
- **Location-Based Filtering**: Find events by current location or city.  
- **User Profiles**: Dashboards for saved events and submitted reviews.  
- **Review System**: Users can rate and write reviews for events.  
- **Search Functionality**: Search events by keywords, date range, or organizer.
